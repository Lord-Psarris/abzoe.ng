                <p class="t-center">There has been a dearth of academic research and clinical diagnoses involving
                    electromyography [EMG] and nerve conduction studies [NCS] in Nigeria despite a rising increase in
                    demand. This has primarily been due to a chronic shortage of trained personnel as well as limited
                    availability and access to the necessary equipment within the country.</p>

                        <p>To this end, ABZoe Solutions plans to provide nationwide services using mobile EMG/NCS
                            machines from December 2021 - February 2022 to increase engagement and exposure to EMG and
                            NCS in both academic and clinical institutions.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Agreements will be reached with interested entities from each institution/city regarding the
                            dates of deployment. This will reduce the overall cost of deploying the solution. </p>

                        <p>EMG/NCS operations will be handled by internationally certified personnel</p>
